# How related are genotypes?

A small experiment to see how many SNPs one does need to look at to see how related two data sets are

Just run `run_all.sh` to download all of *openSNPs* genotypes, unzip them, filter some (un)interesting ones and compare a random selection of these.

In the end you'll have a PDF that has a plot comparing related (aka Â± identical) genotypes and probably unrelated ones.

## requirements
- *python 2.X*
- *R*
- *ggplot2*
